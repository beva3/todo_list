## **Step 1: Understanding the To-Do List Project**  

### **ðŸ“Œ What is a To-Do List?**  
A **To-Do List** is a simple application where users can:  
- **Add** tasks they need to complete.  
- **View** their pending tasks.  
- **Remove** tasks once they are completed.  

### **ðŸ¤” Why Do We Need This?**  
- Helps in **task management**.  
- Keeps track of daily **goals and deadlines**.  
- **Improves productivity** by organizing work efficiently.  
- Used in mobile apps like **Google Keep, Microsoft To Do, Trello**.  

### **ðŸ“Œ Real-Life Example**  
Imagine you have a **daily routine**:  
âœ… Wake up at 6 AM  
âœ… Study Python for 1 hour  
âœ… Complete an assignment  
âœ… Go to the gym  
âœ… Read a book  

A To-Do List app allows you to **track and manage** these tasks easily!

## **Step 2: Requirements for the Project**  

### **ðŸ”¹ Features of Our To-Do List App**  
1. **Add Task** â€“ Users can add tasks to the list.  
2. **View Tasks** â€“ Users can see all pending tasks.  
3. **Remove Task** â€“ Users can mark a task as completed and remove it.  
4. **Save Tasks (Optional)** â€“ Tasks are stored in a file so they donâ€™t disappear after closing the app.  

### **ðŸ”¹ Concepts Used**  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **File Handling (Optional, for saving tasks)**
- **Lists & Dictionaries**
- **User Input & Loops**

## **Step 3: Prototype of All Classes (OOP)**  

We'll use **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** to structure our project.  

### **ðŸ“Œ Class Design for the To-Do List**
```python
class Task:
    """Represents a single task in the To-Do List"""
    def __init__(self, description):
        self.description = description  # Task description
        self.completed = False  # Task status (default: not completed)

    def mark_completed(self):
        """Marks the task as completed"""
        self.completed = True

class ToDoList:
    """Manages the list of tasks"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []  # List of Task objects

    def add_task(self, description):
        """Adds a new task to the list"""
        pass

    def view_tasks(self):
        """Displays all tasks"""
        pass

    def remove_task(self, index):
        """Removes a task by its index"""
        pass

    def save_tasks(self, filename):
        """Saves tasks to a file (optional feature)"""
        pass

    def load_tasks(self, filename):
        """Loads tasks from a file (optional feature)"""
        pass
```
### **ðŸ“Œ Explanation of Classes**
1. **Task Class**  
   - Represents **one task** in the list.  
   - Has a **description** and a **completed** status.  
   - Can be **marked as completed**.  

2. **ToDoList Class**  
   - Manages a **list of Task objects**.  
   - Allows users to **add, view, remove** tasks.  
   - (Optional) Can **save/load** tasks to/from a file.

## **Next Steps**
Now, you should:  
âœ… Understand the class structure  
âœ… Confirm if you want file saving or just a simple list-based approach
